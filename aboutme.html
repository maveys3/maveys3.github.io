          These classes open my perspective on different areas other than programming. They helped as a breather in being in a technical major and somewhat servered as a creative outlet.
          Overall they really didn't help much from a professional stand point. There really wasn't any real benefit I gained that I could use
          in a job.

            <b>General Education Reflection</b>
            <p>GE1: short term, full time back end developer job or full stack, long term, a company that uses a modern stack 
              that I can continue learning everyday. A job that uses primarily JavaScript and Node.js would be great. If the company
              follows best practices, uses agile, and has mandatory code reviews so I could always improve and see what I did wrong would be nice.</p>
            <p>GE2: I had a philosophy class that made me change the way I thought about most choices I made. This in
                turn made me think about how I was solving problems and try to think outside the box. Like what was mentioned above, this is somewhat of a stretch,
              as there really wasn't any skills I was taught that I could really apply to programming.
            </p>
            <p>GE3: Philosophy taught me there are many different "ideas" and not one is only right
                There is still on going discussion and these topics. There is much more than just lets say, 
                is this action morale? The same relates to programming. Does it work? Is it written well though?

            <b>Cumulative Reflection</b>
<article>CR1. For systems design not very much. There may have been two classes that tried to teach about
system design, but it was very unorganized. This led to not learning very much from the course.
Processes were taught fairly well and have prepared me a lot in solving problems and ways to break
them down. This leads to formulating and solving engineering problems. ISU courses helped a lot as
many classes how different ways to solver problems and show you how to solve and break problems
down even further to solve parts of the problem. The impact on engineering solutions not so much.
Ethical implications we had one class that taught this. This seems trivial but has helped put in
  perspective the ethical aspects.</article></br>
<article>CR2. Classes such as COMS 309 and a few other courses has been heavily reliant on team-based
projects. This helped working in groups and learn the strengths and weaknesses of each member and
how to go about this in development. This helped recognize issues and understand ethical
responsibilities. We needed to understand each person and their culture as well. This contributes to
the way work should be done and interactions are done. One culture may see offense to some action
that one other culture may not. These classes helped understand not to generalize and understand to
  try to figure a solution.</article></br>
<article>CR3. Many classes I have had to reach out to other work besides what was given. Classes such as 327
and 418. ComS 418 covers lecture in a way the lectures don’t help the homework assignments.
Additional reading of the textbook and outside material such as research papers are needed to
understand some of the algorithms that are needed to be implemented. ComS 309 was heavily reliant
on outside information such as other engineer blogs or tutorials on learning a new language or
framework. There was little help because each team’s development tools were completely different.</article></br>
<article>CR4. Not applicable. I never attended any of these so I cannot really say how these helped me
understand the importance of Lifelong learning. Though I can say I would personally not want to work
at a place where I am not continuously learning. I would like to be challenged and stay up to date with
  the latest technology.</article></br>
<article>CR5. I have done a lot of programming outside of class to dive into web development. I feel the ISU
courses don’t adequately focus on web development and wanted more exposure in depth. I enjoy
web development a lot more as well which is why I chose to focus on learning to improve my skills in
  web development instead.</article></br>
<article>CR6. I would start programming early. When I first started, I didn’t really have a passion for
programming and only tried to pass my courses. This led to a lack of understanding the fundamentals
early on and was a struggle catching up. I would focus on web development earlier outside of classes
when I had time. I would also focus more on course work to make sure I fully understand the course
material instead of just enough to pass and then put it in the back of my head. I would try to participate
  more in clubs and activities related to programming.</article></br>

  <b>Ethics Essay</b>
  <p>This is a tough one. Elizabeth had this idea that would better the world yet came no where near developing the technology for it. She blackmailed the employees and ex-employees if they tried to come out. I would have to say I would try to come out and let everyone know through an anonymous tip. I personally would not want a lawsuit filed against me even if it was selfish, I would rather leave the company. I would not continue working at a place that is unethical towards my point of view.

I personally think Elizabeth had good intentions from the beginning but was lost along the way through all the money and hype. Everyone made her sound like she was a genius and the next and upcoming star in technology that would break grounds. To not want to disappoint she kept lying and taking funds. She may have thought it would be shameful to have failed here after all the praise and gotten out of hand lying.
