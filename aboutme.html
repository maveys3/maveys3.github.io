            <b>General Education Reflection</b>
            <p>GE1: short term, full time back end developer job or full stack, long term, a company that uses a modern stack that I can continue learning everyday</p>
            <p>GE2: I had a philosophy class that made me change the way I thought about most choices I made. This in
                turn made me think about how I was solving problems and try to think outside the box.
            </p>
            <p>GE3: Philosophy taught me there are many different "ideas" and not one is only right
                There is still on going discussion and these topics. There is much more than just lets say, 
                is this action morale? The same relates to programming. Does it work? Is it written well though?
            </p>
        </div>

        <br><div>
            <b>Cumulative Reflection</b>
            <p>CR1: 
                ISU did great in teaching how to solve problems.
            </p>
            <p>CR2:
                Classes at ISU that have you work in groups really helped me learn how to communicate and work out
                each memeber's strength and weaknesses. Classes like Com S 309 helped me learn the importance of culture in 
                the workplace as well. Not everyone thinks the same and everyone's belief and ideas need to be respected.
            </p>
            <p>CR3:
                Yes most classes I had to do extra research outside of class. Most classes it seemed taught principles 
                yet do not show exactly how to use these principles or why you should use them over anything else.
            </p>
            <p>CR4:
                I don't have any expierence with any of these that helped with the importance of lifelong learning.
            </p>
            <p>CR5:
                I have began to research new topics that are interesting to me that ISU does not teach. This helps broaden 
                the way I go about problem solving because I have to think differently for each topic.
            </p>
            <p>CR6:
                I would take more extra cirricular activities related to my major and interests. I would also 
                begin researching more into topics that interest me instead of waiting until my third year to broaden my horizon.
